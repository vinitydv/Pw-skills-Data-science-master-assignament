    "## Q1. In order to predict house price based on several characteristics, such as location, square footage, number of bedrooms, etc., you are developing an SVM regression model. Which regression metric in this situation would be the best to employ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: To determine which regression metric would be the best for the given dataset, we can start by exploring the data and the distribution of the target variable. We can also split the data into training and testing sets and evaluate different regression metrics on the testing set to see which one performs better.\n",
    "\n",
    "After exploring the dataset, it appears that the target variable, price, is continuous and right-skewed. Therefore, it may be more appropriate to use a regression metric that is less sensitive to outliers. In this case, the mean absolute error (MAE) would be a better choice since it measures the average absolute difference between the predicted and actual values.\n",

In the case of predicting house prices, it gives higher weight to larger errors, which can be significant when predicting the price of a high-value asset like a house. It also penalizes the model more heavily for larger errors, which can help to identify models that are less accurate in predicting house prices.\n",

    "## Q4. You have built an SVM regression model using a polynomial kernel and are trying to select the best metric to evaluate its performance. You have calculated both MSE and RMSE and found that both values are very close. Which metric should you choose to use in this case?\n",
    "Ans:If both MSE and RMSE values are very close in an SVM regression model using a polynomial kernel, it is generally better to choose RMSE as the evaluation metric.\n",

    "The reason for this is that RMSE takes the square root of the MSE, which has the effect of converting the error metric back to the same units as the original data, making it more interpretable.
