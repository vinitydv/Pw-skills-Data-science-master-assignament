    "Outliers are extreme values in a dataset that are significantly different from the other values in the distribution. They can have a significant impact on measures of central tendency and dispersion.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of measures of central tendency, outliers can significantly affect the mean. Since the mean is calculated by summing all the values and dividing by the number of values, outliers can disproportionately influence the sum and thus the mean. For example, consider the following dataset: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10. The mean of this dataset is (1+2+3+4+5+10)/6 = 25/6 = 4.17. However, if we remove the outlier (10), the mean becomes (1+2+3+4+5)/5 = 15/5 = 3, which is significantly different.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of measures of dispersion, outliers can significantly affect the range, variance, and standard deviation. The range is the difference between the highest and lowest values in the dataset, so a single outlier can greatly increase the range. Similarly, the variance and standard deviation are both measures of how spread out the data is around the mean, so outliers can greatly increase these measures. For example, consider the following dataset: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 100. The range of this dataset is 99, the variance is 866, and the standard deviation is 29.43. However, if we remove the outlier (100), the range becomes 4, the variance becomes 2.5, and the standard deviation becomes 1.58.\n",

    "In summary, outliers can have a significant impact on measures of central tendency and dispersion, and it is important to carefully consider the presence of outliers when analyzing a dataset.\n",
