    "## Q1. Pearson correlation coefficient is a measure of the linear relationship between two variables. Suppose you have collected data on the amount of time students spend studying for an exam and their final exam scores. Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between these two variables and interpret the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: To calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between the amount of time students spend studying for an exam and their final exam scores, you will need to have collected data on both variables from a sample of students. Once you have collected the data, you can use the following formula to calculate the correlation coefficient:\n",
    "\n",
    "r = (Σ(x - x̄)(y - ȳ)) / √(Σ(x - x̄)²Σ(y - ȳ)²)\n",
    "\n",
    "where x and y are the two variables (in this case, the amount of time spent studying and the final exam scores), x̄ and ȳ are their respective means, and Σ represents the sum of the values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting correlation coefficient, r, will be a value between -1 and 1. A value of 1 indicates a perfect positive correlation, meaning that as one variable increases, the other variable also increases in a linear fashion. A value of -1 indicates a perfect negative correlation, meaning that as one variable increases, the other variable decreases in a linear fashion. A value of 0 indicates no linear correlation between the two variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpreting the result of the correlation coefficient calculation will depend on the value obtained. If the correlation coefficient is positive and close to 1, this would suggest a strong positive linear relationship between the amount of time spent studying and final exam scores. This means that students who spent more time studying tended to score higher on the exam. On the other hand, if the correlation coefficient is negative and close to -1, this would suggest a strong negative linear relationship between the amount of time spent studying and final exam scores. This would indicate that students who spent less time studying tended to score higher on the exam. Finally, if the correlation coefficient is close to 0, this would suggest that there is no linear relationship between the two variables, and studying time does not have a significant impact on final exam scores.\n",

The Pearson correlation coefficient measures the strength of the linear relationship between two variables, while the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient measures the strength of the monotonic relationship between two variables.

If the relationship between the two variables is monotonic, then the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient will be higher.\n",
